Pro Image Sports uses Franpos for POS sales, time clock tracking, inventory management, and for integration with e-Commerce sales. Franpos does not expose any APIs for uses other than e-commerce integration. With no custom reports available, managers must click though and filter various reports to collect the same data each week. 

These scripts are written to automate the most common tasks. Step by step instructions are provided through comments. The scripts are only used by two store locations once a week, so a python notebook is sufficient for the current workload. As scripts and store participation increase, the architecture must adapt.
